# Leap Year

Occuring once every 4 years, a leap year has 366 days including February 29th, which is known as an intercalary day.

In this task you will be provided with a random year, then asked to determine if the given year is a leap year. 

The following rules apply to leap years: 

    Every year that is evenly divisible by 4,
    except every year that is evenly divisible by 100,
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

You must apply these rules and return a true boolean value if the year given is a leap year, or false if it is not a leap year.
