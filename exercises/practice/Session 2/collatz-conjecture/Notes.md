# Collatz Conjecture

Two-Fer, short for two for one or "One for you, one for me." 
In this exercise, we'll want to replace parts of the sentece with a name, which will be provided to us.

## Objectives
    - Modify the provided code so that it produces the string "One for you, one for me.", where "you" is replaced by a name provided by the tests
    - If no name is provided, the code should instead return, "you".
    - Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
