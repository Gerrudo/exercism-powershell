# Neocleotide Count

Nucleotides are individual elements contained within a DNA strand. There are 4 different types which exist, and each has been assigned a letter: A, C, G and T.

For this task, you'll need to be able to return the number of each type of nucleotide in a given DNA strand. 

You will be provided with a strand, for example: AACGCCTACG. You will then need to return the count of each nucleotide as a string, like this: "A:3 C:4 G:2 T:1"

## Objectives
* Modify the provided code so that it returns a string showing the number of each nucleotide in the provided strand.
* Should throw an error if given a letter that is not a valid nucleotide (A, C, G or T)
* All test suites must complete with no errors.

## Topics Covered
* Foreach Loops
    * `$item in $ItemList`
    * Datatypes that can be used in a foreach loop
    * Foreach loop is privately scoped

* Switch Statements
    * Comparing data used in a switch statement
    * Where you'd want to use a switch statement
    * Using defaults

* Topics from other lessons to include
    * Iteration
    * String Templating
    * Throwing exceptions
